Assume you have something called an electric metre. This gadget allows you to keep track of how much power you're consuming in various locations, such as your lights and kitchen appliances.

The gadget also features a simple menu that you may utilise:

  -You can specify how much power you're currently utilising.
  -You can determine if you are using too much in any area.
  -You can view how much power you have remaining in each category.
  -Of course, you may exit when you're finished.

Here's how it works:

  -When you start, you tell the device how much electricity you have in total.
  -Then, you can divide that total into different categories, like how much electricity you want to use for your lights, how much for your refrigerator, etc.
  -As you use electricity, you can tell the device how much you've used for each category.
  -If you're using too much electricity in one category and might run out, the device will warn you and might even borrow some electricity from another category to make sure you don't run out completely.
  -At any time, you can check how much electricity you have left in each category.
